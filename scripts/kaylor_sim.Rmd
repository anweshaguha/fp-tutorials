## Outline

Overall goal: demonstrate ways to generate datasets for classroom use!

Part 1: Mocking up data based on existing data set (of numerical/character data) 
- Load in data, and produce descriptive stats.
- Create a list of the columns/data types that are you are looking to mock up.
- Populate the list with mocked data, depending on the types. 
- Loop through the process, depending on # of data sets needed. 
- Demonstrate function that walks them through the process
-- Simulating different types of data!
- Mocking numerical data
-- Distribution functions, lists
- Mocking character data
-- Use of stringi for character strings
-- Generate strings of specific length/format
- Mocking logical data
